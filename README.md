# IOTOfficeSecuritySystem
Project Overview

We will be utilising a motion sensor to sense movement andoutputs catering to audio and visuals will be triggered once movements aredetected. Phone alerts would also be triggered in the event. A piCam would alsobe used to capture images.

One raspberry pi will act as the sensor to capture image while the other raspberry pi will act as the actuator to send notifications and alert the office.
